While reading this novel, I felt so deeply connected to the characters. So much so that I carry them with with me now. I find myself thinking about these guys on a daily basis. I wonder how they are doing. What they are thinking. How they are coping with the calamity they had to deal with during the week I spent with them. Obviously, I know they are fiction. Except, they really aren't. The author just has a really interesting take on the world and he sees every Human Being as someone with a beautifully flawed but equally interesting story. I see the characters he created everywhere and I love that. I cannot decide which book of his is my favorite. They are both so wonderful. I really hope you love it as much as I did.

Throughout the novel, the author introduces you to many characters and each one has astonishing depth. Even in it's many digressions to introduce these characters and wide ranging discussion, there is a not a single line that wastes the reader's time. Every sentence moves the plot forward and kept me glued to the book for days. I look forward to reading it again and again. The cover says it is part of the CF Fiction series... The Name of the Book is on the way and I can't wait to read the rest."}]
