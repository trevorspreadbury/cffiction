Short stories are certainly not everyone\u2019s cup of words, but many people simply don\u2019t realize how extremely satisfying it is to read a complete story with vivid characters and an engaging plot, all done in a distinctive and well delivered manner . Each story was unique and well written with few of the stories\u2019 ending with a twist I didn't see coming. This is a truly inventive collection of William's short stories and although I enjoyed his other novel too, \u201cCalamitous Fortunes\u201d, I\u2019m hoping that he will publish another book soon. He has a gifted imagination and this collection is definitely one of my favorites."}, {"name": "SRH", "quoteText": "Remarkable read.

I found in a macabre way I was able to relate to them. This is not your ordinary book with ordinary circumstances. The twists are built up in crescendo so that you are unable to leave the story...until that final reveal. And then you get this rush of finality as the story comes to an end. A few of them I wanted to jump up and give a standing ovation."}, {"name": "Bruce R.

You need to read this book. I promise there is at least one story in this book that will speak to you. For me, it was all ten. Each had a character I related to, a story that I both recognized and did not (in the utmost positive way), and an idea that made me truly think. I wish I could express to you eloquently that you must read this book, but I do not possess the writing skills for this.
